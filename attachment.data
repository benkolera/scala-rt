Content: Hi Chris,
         
         GJR would like prepaid notifications to be set up.
         
         Can you please get the ball rolling when convenient and let me know if I need to chase up any further information.
         
         Cheers,
         Linda

         Hi Linda,
         
         GJR need the following alerts set up
         
         100MB, 500MB, 1000MB, 5000MB (Chenry advised it works on data remaining basis rather than a % for pre paid)
         
         The rest of the info is as follows

         Dear Customer,
         
         You have XXXMB remaining on your GJR Prepaid Wireless Internet.  Now might be a good time to consider recharging.  Any remaining data will be rolled over into your new recharge period.  To recharge, please call our office on (03) 5497 2181.
         
         Regards

         Hi Greg,
         
         here are the details you requested:
         
          From address:  support@gjr.net.au
         Subject:  GJR Wireless Usage Alert
         Body:
         
         Dear Customer,
         
         You have XXXMB remaining on your GJR Prepaid Wireless Internet.  Now might be a good time to consider recharging.  Any remaining data will be rolled over into your new recharge period.  To recharge, please call our office on (03) 5497 2181.

         GJR Internet
         
         
         Thresholds:  100MB, 500MB, 1000MB, 5000MB
         
         Having a look over the contract you sent, the monthly cap listed in there is only 12gb, where as you said below that it would be 20gb.  Is this just a typo?
         
         Cheers
         
         John.
