Warning - Crappy Alpha Software!
================================

This is a first go at a scala based interface to RT. It hasn't been production
tested and is still pretty crusty codebase-wise yet so use at your own peril! 

Installation
============
This isn't on maven central, so you'll have to install by going:

* git clone https://github.com/benkolera/scala-rt.git
* sbt publish-local
